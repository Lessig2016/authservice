## tl;dr

* **Applicable skills** TBD
* **Slack** [#gh-authservice](https://teamlessigtech.slack.com/messages/gh-authservice/)
* **Project lead** TBD

## Getting started

First, make sure the service is configured. You'll need to run

    cp config_NOCOMMIT_README config_NOCOMMIT.py

and then edit `config_NOCOMMIT.py` to contain some API keys and secrets.

This service must run over HTTPS on something that your computer's hostname
resolution thinks is `auth.mayday.us`. This is because we are using secure
cookies, which your browser requires pass over HTTPS for subdomains of
`mayday.us`.

The easiest way to get an HTTPS server running is to run

    docker pull jtolds/mayone-gae
    docker run -t -i -v /path/to/your/checkout:/develop jtolds/mayone-gae /start.sh /develop

(`start.sh` runs `dev_appserver.py` for you and sets up stunnel to wrap HTTPS
 traffic)

Run `docker ps` to find the container id of your running instance, then find
its IP address by running

    docker inspect -f "{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}" container_id

Finally, add the container's IP and `auth.mayday.us` to your `/etc/hosts` file.

Another sample app that uses `auth.mayday.us` is checked in under the
`example/` subdir. Setting it up to use HTTPS is similar.

When testing, you can remove app auth here: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications
